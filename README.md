# ObsidianGPT ‚ú®üß†

**ObsidianGPT is an AI-powered assistant designed to supercharge your Obsidian vault, providing intelligent analysis, querying, and content generation capabilities directly within a user-friendly web interface.**

This project combines a FastAPI backend for interacting with your local Obsidian notes and an LLM (like one running in LM Studio), with a Streamlit frontend for intuitive user interaction.
