# Second Brain

Second Brain is a personal knowledge management system that integrates with your Obsidian vault and uses a language model to analyze, query, and process your notes. It acts as a personal assistant, helping you extract insights, analyze connections, and perform daily reviews.

## Features

- **Automatic Note Processing**: Automatically processes and analyzes notes in your Obsidian vault.
- **Query Notes**: Ask questions about specific notes and get detailed answers.
- **Analyze Connections**: Compare two notes to find overlaps, contradictions, and synthesis points.
- **Daily Reviews**: Automatically generate daily reviews for your notes.
- **Customizable**: Configure excluded folders, daily note templates, and language model parameters.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10 or higher
- Dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`
